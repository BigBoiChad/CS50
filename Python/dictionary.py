# Python is so much easier to write and understand than c
# So pyhthon is a higher level of writting a code , where I might dont need to think at a lower level
# In python we dont need to understand what happened under the hood

# This is achieved because python itself is a programm that functions as an interpretor
# Thus Run pyhton might take much more time than Run C
